# Micrograd

Similar to this: [Andrej's repository](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

Added changes that I found interesting like activation functions being classes.

# TODO

- Add tests
- Train on some simple regression model
- Add cross entropy loss
- Train on MNIST
- Implement this in Mojo ðŸ”¥
